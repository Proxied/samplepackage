===========
Sample Package
===========

This is an example Python package of modules. It has a bare-bones, skeleton version of all common files.
To see how to run the samples, read ./docs/USAGE.txt


Everything past this point is to show how to edit a README.rst file. Open the raw version of this file to understand how to do the things shown.
Example code::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from samplepackage import sample
	from samplepackage import sample2

    sample.hello()
	sample2.goodbye()

This is a header
=========

Lists look like this:

* Thing 1

* Thing 2

This is a sub-header
-------------

You can also create ordered lists:

1. Thing 1

2. Thing 2

Text can be **bold**, *italicized*, or ``monospace``.
You can link a url as expected: http://google.com
And link something `like this <http://google.com>`_.
